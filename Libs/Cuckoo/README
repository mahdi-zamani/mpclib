Project outline:

cuckoo.py: A high level cuckoo rule simulator used to find good group sizes

rangebst.py: A binary search tree that supports a ranged lookup function

mkfigs.py: Takes the output of cuckoo.py and makes figures


To run the system:

On Ubuntu:
0) sudo apt-get install pypy python-matplotlib
1) pypy cuckoo.py > result_file
2) python mkfigs.py ../results_file


NOTES:

* pypy is a python interpreter with JIT, it's *much* faster than the
standard python interpreter for applications like this one.  

* the mkfigs command will create a pdf ../results_file.pdf and also show you
the figure in an X window.

* the files in results/ are named as such: results_<num_attacks>_kvalue where kvalue is either std (meaning minimum recommended value) or k=1 or k=15.  If <num_attacks> is missing then the value is 10,000.
