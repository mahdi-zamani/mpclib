MpcLib - A Multi-Party Computation Library

This library implements a framework for secure multi-party computation of arbitrary arithmetic circuits. 

In secure multi-party computation (MPC), a set of parties, each having a secret value (input), want to compute a common 
function over their inputs, without revealing any information about their inputs other than what is revealed by the output 
of the function.
